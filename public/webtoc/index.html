  <h1>WebTOC Browser Extension Development Journey</h1>
  <p>This is a browser extension that can fetch the outline of the current web page.</p>
<p>The initial idea for this extension came from the book <em>How to Read a Book</em>, which mentions using a book&rsquo;s table of contents and outline to quickly grasp its content.</p>
<p>When browsing online, it&rsquo;s common to encounter websites without a quick navigation outline. For example, on my blog site, I believe a good blog post should be engaging and narrative, rather than having a clear, structured hierarchy like Wikimedia. So, I removed the table of contents from my blog.</p>
<p>However, there are times when we want to quickly assess whether an article is worth reading further or locate a solution without delving into the details. A browser extension that fetches the outline of any web page would be an excellent solution.</p>
<p>Initially, I designed a floating window for the current page. Users could freely move and resize this window, ensuring that the outline doesn&rsquo;t obstruct the web content, thus maintaining a good reading experience.</p>
<p><img alt="image-20240730153439315" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyixi/Pics/main/uPic/image-20240730153439315.png"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the first MVP.</p>
<p><img alt="image-20240730153720721" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyixi/Pics/main/uPic/image-20240730153720721.png"></p>
<p><img alt="image-20240730153641546" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyixi/Pics/main/uPic/image-20240730153658676.png"></p>
<p>The control bar at the top was initially inspired by the MacOS system, featuring a close button. Later, the close button was moved to the badge.</p>
<p>This is a demo of the control bar during the development phase, hosted on CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/huyixi/pen/OJeVyYE">https://codepen.io/huyixi/pen/OJeVyYE</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the extension&rsquo;s background was optimized. It adapts to the background color of the current web page, ensuring a better visual experience. The approach involves extracting the page&rsquo;s RGB color, converting it to HSL, and then reducing the lightness (L). The background lightness is decreased by 4%, and the control bar by another 4%, resulting in a more pleasant color scheme.</p>
<p>At this point, the extension was nearly complete and met my needs.</p>
<p>However, while browsing at home over the weekend, I came across a <a href="https://x.com/galala_eth/status/1816277009707983071">tweet</a> from a user named galala_eth:</p>
<p><img alt="835shots_so" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyixi/Pics/main/uPic/835shots_so.png"></p>
<p>The tweet mentioned a tool called Uniswap, which piqued my curiosity. I checked it out and found that the first pinned tweet described their browser extension, which now displays content in a sidebar.</p>

<p><img alt="183shots_so" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huyixi/Pics/main/uPic/183shots_so.png"></p>
<p>It was the first wallet extension to use this method. It struck me as a great display method, prompting me to scrap the previous code and start over.</p>

<p>This is the current display effect. The screenshot is taken from <a href="https://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>&rsquo;s famous article <a href="https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html"><em>Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</em></a>, with some distracting elements removed.</p>
<p>The project is currently under review in the Google Store.</p>

<p>Once the review is approved, a download link for the extension will be provided.</p>
