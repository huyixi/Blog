Last week, during some spare time, I worked on a Sidebar Project: a Raycast plugin that allows you to get the current time in a specified format.

When writing blog entries, I often need to get a precise timestamp (to help recall my thoughts later). However, since I use Apple’s built-in input method, I can’t simply type sj to get the current time like with Sogou or other Chinese input methods. I also discovered that there’s no setting available for this feature. So, I created this small Raycast plugin to achieve it.

Later, I realized that the Rime input method I’m using can actually input time through Rime’s Lua plugins, providing an even smoother experience.
