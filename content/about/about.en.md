👋 Hello, welcome to huyixi's personal blog.

I also have two other websites:

- [huyixi.com](https://huyixi.com) is my personal brand website.
- [huyixi.wiki](https://huyixi.wiki) is my personal knowledge base, where I use this site to lighten the memory load on my brain.
- [散步周刊](https://weekly.huyixi.com) is my personal weekly newsletter where I share some fun things each week.
- [Now](https://now.huyixi.com) (under development) is where I will update what I am currently working on.

Blogs I Have Previously Created:

- [Blue](https://blue.huyixi.com/zh/): The second version of my blog, built with Hugo. I really like some of the designs in this version, such as the sidebar layout on the homepage, the book page-turning effect on the Like page, and the table of contents navigation on the article pages.
- [White](https://white.huyixi.com): The third version of my blog.
  The code for the first version of the blog has already been lost.
